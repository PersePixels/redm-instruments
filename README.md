# redm-instruments
Simple script that lets you play instruments.

It's an edit of [Kibook's script](https://github.com/kibook/redm-instruments) because MIDI functionality no longer works

The only issue I'm having right now is getting prompts to stay when active, so if anyone can help with that, that'd be appreciated!
