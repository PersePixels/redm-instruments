# redm-instruments
Simple script that lets you play instruments.

Use /instrument to start the script, and /instrument piano near a piano to play the animation

/instrument stop can be used to stop any instrument animation as well

It's an edit of [Kibook's script](https://github.com/kibook/redm-instruments) because MIDI functionality no longer works in RedM

There's no sound, so players can stream their own music while playing
